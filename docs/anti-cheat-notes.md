# Anti-Cheat Notes

Planned safeguards for production:

- Play Integrity / App Attest signals to detect tampering.
- Device jailbreak/root detection.
- Server-side heuristics: speed caps, impossible travel, GPS jitter analysis.
- Signed location beacons or partner-provided verification.

These are roadmap items only; no implementation in this prototype.
