# GPS Notes

- Android requires runtime permission for fine location.
- iOS requires location usage strings in the Info.plist (to be added when building).
- The Boot scene blocks progression when GPS is disabled or permission is denied.
- Simulated GPS is available for development and should remain disabled in production.
